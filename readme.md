# TakeSafe

TakeSafe is an iOS app for tracking drugs in your body. With simple and detailed infographics youâ€™ll know exactly what you put in your body.

## Current State

TakeSafe was abandoned due to a loss of interest. It was created during my biology course as a way to learn more about psychopharmacology.

## Missing Components

There are some missing components to TakeSafe. They are easy to fix if one puts their mind to it:

- Visual illustration of drug in body
- Timeline combined with heart rate and more metrics

## Structure

TakeSafe retrieves data from the [TakeSafe API](https://api.takesafe.app).
If you want the source code for the API, contact me.

## Sentry

TakeSafe uses Sentry for crash reporting. The original organization has removed from Sentry but you can setup your own and change `fastlane/Fastfile`.
